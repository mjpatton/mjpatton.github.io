Hey! This is the very first update in my blog!

Monday was the day of my gifted party, which is an annual party at my school in which all of the student of the gifted group 
gather and PARTY!  After that, my school had an ice cream social, and finally, I went to my brothers' track banquet!  In 
general, Monday I ate a lot of very unhealthy, but yummy, food!
On Wednesday, I got sick, but I was all better Thursday morning!  I'm excited to spend the weekend relaxing at Lake Erie!
